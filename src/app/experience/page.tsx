      Hey. I&apos;m a frontend developer with a backstory of a failed game dev
      dream, a brief backend fantasy, and a history of roasting frontend devs…
      before I became one. Now I spend most of my time turning Figma files into
      satisfying UIs, obsessing over tiny animations, and building weird side
      projects I never finish. I&apos;ve worked on performance review platforms,
      AI-powered carbon trading tools, and client websites that actually look
      good. Sometimes I even write tests voluntarily. Yeah, I don&apos;t know
      what happened either. I&apos;m currently working at a startup, doing
      everything from UX overhauls to autosave logic, writing test cases, and
      trying not to break prod. Before this, I messed around with React Native
      and Hugging Face to build an OCR app solo for a final year college project
      — which was *supposed* to be a group effort. Looking to level up,
      freelance a bit, and build things that feel *really* good to use.
